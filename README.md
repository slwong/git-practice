**************************** https authentication ***************************
1) I don't understand why git does not ask for credential on each push ??
2) May be VSC is using the windows credential to automatically access git with HTTPS. Attempt using Solar 
Putty instead to test.
Yes it is confirmed that VSC is getting the credential from the Git desktop on windows credential. 
3) The git for windows stored the credential on window credential manager.



***************************** ssh authentication ****************************
1) cp ssh key/pair from the node red ~/.node-red/.sshkey folder does not work
Have to find a way to set git with existing key
